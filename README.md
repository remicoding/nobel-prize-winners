# A Visual History of Nobel Prize Winners

This project is based on the [DataCamp Project](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/441) of the same name.

The goal of the project is to analyze and visualize the [Nobel Laureates, 1901-Present](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates) dataset from Kaggle to discover insights such as:

- Is the prize still Eurocentric and male-focused?
- What characteristics do the prize winners have?
- Which country gets it most often?
- Has anybody gotten it twice?, etc ...

The skills displayed in the project include:

- Data Visualization (Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning
- Data Analysis
